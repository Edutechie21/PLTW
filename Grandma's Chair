Project Title:Grandma's Chair
Team Members: kathy and Liz

Section:


Task Description:Build, wire and program a model to represent a chair for Grandma to ride up and down
instead of walking the stairs. A Pushbutton switch is used for Grandma when she's ready to go up or down.
Limit Switch Sensors are used to determine when the chair has arrived at that floor. One motor is needed
to move the chair up and down.


Pseudocode:
loop forever
if chair pushbutton pressed
if bottom floor limit switch is pressed
Chair moves up
Top limit switch pressed
Chair stops
else if top floor limit switch is pressed
Chair moves down
Bottom limit switch pressed
Chair stops
