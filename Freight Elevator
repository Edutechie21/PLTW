Project Title: Freight elevator
Team Members: Ken Parmley Brant Schumacher
Date:8/10/17
Section:


Task Description: You are an employee at a VEX factory. Your job requires you to deliver parts to various floors
of the factory. Since a lifetime of climbing up and down stairs doesnâ€™t sound attractive to you,
you seek an alternative. Luckily, you have found a solution to this problem. Before a full-sized freight elevator
can be built, a fully functioning scaled model must be built


Pseudocode:
Forever
If the 1st floor button is pressed
Move motor downwait until 1st floor line tracker is light
stop motor
Else if the 3rd floor button is pressed
Move motor up
wait until 3rd floor line tracker is light
stop motor
Else if the 2nd floor button is pressed
if 1st floor light sensor is light
move up
Else
Move down
wait until 2nd floor light sensor is light
stop motor
else
stop motor
