Task Description:
Model, wire and program a bridge that will allow trains to cross when closed, then it will
rotate 90 degrees to allow boats to pass under the bridge.

run continuously
when button is pushed
turn on motor
wait until the pot is greater than
bridge stops
push button
wait until the pot is less than
bridge stops
turn off motor
